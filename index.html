              <li ><strong >1980 –</strong> Showed early interest in reading and storytelling but discovered her passion for mathematics during high school.</li>
              <li><strong>1994 –</strong> Won her first gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad (Hong Kong) at age 17.</li>
              <li><strong>1995 –</strong> Won her second gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad (Canada) at age 18, achieving a perfect score.</li>
              <li><strong>1999 –</strong> Graduated with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from Sharif University of Technology, a leading university in Tehran, known for producing many of Iran’s top mathematicians and scientists.</li>
              <li><strong>1999 –</strong> Moved to the United States to pursue graduate studies in mathematics at Harvard University.</li>
              <li><strong>2004 –</strong> Completed her PhD at Harvard University under the supervision of Curtis McMullen (Fields Medalist in 1998). Her thesis on moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces was regarded as a remarkable achievement.</li>
              <li><strong>2004-2008 –</strong> Appointed as an assistant professor at Princeton University, one of the top universities in the world.</li>
              <li><strong>2005 –</strong> Married Jan Vondrák, a Czech theoretical computer scientist, whom she met during her time at Princeton.</li>
              <li><strong>2008 –</strong> Joined the faculty of Stanford University as a full professor of mathematics, where she continued her groundbreaking research.</li>
              <li><strong>2011 –</strong> Gave birth to her daughter, Anahita Vondrák, who became a source of great joy for her. Maryam reportedly enjoyed teaching her daughter Farsi and sharing Persian literature.</li>
              <li><strong>2013 –</strong> Made significant progress on several mathematical problems, including research on geodesics and the ergodic theory of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces.</li>
              <li><strong>2014 –</strong> Awarded the Fields Medal, the highest honor in mathematics, during the International Congress of Mathematicians in Seoul, South Korea. Her work on Riemann surfaces and Teichmüller theory was hailed as one of the most important developments in geometry.</li>
              <li><strong>2016 –</strong> Continued research and teaching at Stanford University, balancing her work as a mother and an academic despite her battle with cancer.</li>
              <li><strong>2017 –</strong> Passed away on July 14 at the age of 40 after a long battle with breast cancer. Her passing was mourned worldwide, especially in the mathematics community.</li>

  <p>“Maryam was a brilliant mathematical theorist, and also a humble person who accepted honors only with the hope that it might encourage others to follow her path. Her contributions as both a scholar and a role model are significant and enduring, and she will be dearly missed here at Stanford and around the world.”</p>
